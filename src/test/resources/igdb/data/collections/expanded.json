      "summary": "Bubsy 3D is the fourth Bubsy game to date, and the only title in 3D; the game was released in 1996 for the PlayStation video game console. It is a sequel to the original in terms of the story and takes place on the Woolies' home planet, Rayon. Bubsy 3D has 16 main levels and two boss levels and the main character's goal is to defeat the two queens of Rayon, Poly and Esther. The player can collect rockets, as well as atoms, in order to eventually escape from planet Rayon. The graphics are very simplistic, even for their time, with a dense fog that covers entire levels throughout the game. Bubsy actively speaks throughout the game based on various actions performed by the player. Planned releases for the Sega 32X and Sega Saturn were cancelled.\nBubsy 3D was panned by both critics due to its confusing control schemes and camera angles. It was featured on Seanbaby's EGM Crapstravaganza: The 20 Worst Games of All Time list as well as in eighth place on GameTrailers' 2006 Top 10 Best and Worst Games list, where it was described as \"a terrible, terrible clone\".",

      "summary": "Is Bubsy a celebrated icon from the mascot wars of the early 90s or a platforming punchline? The team at Limited Run has built a new collection to find the answer. Bubsy in: The Purrfect Collection explores the franchise's troubled history and enduring popularity.\n\nBubsy in: The Purrfect Collection is a playable history that includes games, artifacts and interviews. All of the games have been carefully updated for modern PCs and consoles using Limited Run’s proprietary Carbon Engine. Along the way the team was able to smooth out some of the games’ rough edges.\n\nAt the helm of the project is Limited Run’s Audi Sorlie, a producer, author, Bubsy World Heavyweight Champion and arguably the world’s foremost expert on the furry franchise. Together with the team at Limited Run and Atari, he has created the ultimate retrospective celebration of Bubsy, the 3’6” tall 80 pound bobcat (with a pet armadillo named Arnold). What could possibly go wrong?",
